This introductory lecture has been pre-recorded for the course and is accessible as a YouTube playlist from: [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7pQ8oKpQhFWR-_R26obCTtBSFprLlkLP).
It consists of five videos:
- Part 1: [https://youtu.be/vDYaKvOFh_k](https://youtu.be/vDYaKvOFh_k) 12:47
- Part 2 [https://youtu.be/b7cbuw81iU8](https://youtu.be/b7cbuw81iU8) 4:22
- Illumina Sequencing by Synthesis [https://youtu.be/fCd6B5HRaZ8](https://youtu.be/fCd6B5HRaZ8) 5:13
- Part 3 [https://youtu.be/68tNkPBFsJk](https://youtu.be/68tNkPBFsJk) 16:50

 - [https://youtu.be/v8p4ph2MAvI](https://youtu.be/v8p4ph2MAvI)
 
The total length of the video playlist is about 48 minutes, so we have about 10 minutes for discussion during the one-hour session.

This lecture covers:

 - Introduction to DNA sequencing.
 - Sequencing by synthesis.
 - Second-generation sequencing: 454 and Illumina.
 - Paired-read sequencing.
 - FASTQ format for sequence data and quality scores.
 - Plotting distributions of quality scores using [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). 
 - Single-molecule sequencing methods: Oxford Nanopore and Pacific Biosciences.

Give the breadth of the subject, this lecture really just scratches the surface. There will be opportunities during the course o delve more deeply into some of these topics and discuss with the course training team.
