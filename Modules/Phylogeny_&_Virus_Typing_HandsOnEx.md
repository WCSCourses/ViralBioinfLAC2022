**Viral Genomics and Bioinformatics Latin America and the Caribbean**
10 - 14 October 2022

**Topic: Phylogenetics & Virus Typing**

**Instructors: Dr. Carolina Torres & Dr. Marta Giovanetti**


**Introduction to the Hands-on exercises**

**DATASET 1: SARS-CoV-2**
SARS-CoV-2 diversity and evolution are reflected by both variants and lineages. The Pango nomenclature is a system for identifying SARS-CoV-2 genetic lineages of epidemiological relevance and is being used by researchers and public health agencies worldwide to track the transmission and spread of SARS-CoV-2, including variants of concern (VOCs) (https://www.pango.network/).
The objective of the practical activity is to assign the Pango lineage to a group of SARS-CoV-2 sequences obtained in Latin America.
For that purpose, we have built a dataset of complete genome sequences consisting of 40 reference sequences of several Pango lineages (indicated at the beginning of the sequence names) and 10 sequences from some Latin American countries (indicated as “query” at the beginning of the sequence names).

**DATASET 2: Dengue virus (DENV)**
Dengue infections are caused by four closely related viruses (DENV-1 to DENV-4). DENV-4 is classified into four genotypes (I-III and Sylvatic).
The objective of the practical activity is to genotype three DENV-4 isolates that circulated in Brazil in 2012-2013 (“query”) and determine if they belong to a single transmission chain. 
For that purpose, we have built a dataset consisting of 37 complete genome sequences of this virus including reference sequences of the DENV-4 genotypes (indicated at the end of the sequence names as I-III and Sylvatic), the sequences of interest (indicated as “query” at the beginning of the sequence names) and sequences of DENV-1 to DENV-3 as outgroup.
